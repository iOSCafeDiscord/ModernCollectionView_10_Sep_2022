# ModernCollectionView_10_Sep_2022

CollectionViews in iOS are pretty powerful and flexible. We can use them to make any performant interface. 

With the release of iOS 13 SDK, Apple introduced a new API in UICollectionView which is called Compositional Layout.

With Compositional Layout, Apple decided to re-address the problem of making collection views easier to use.

With this new powerful layout API, we can build complex layouts without much hassle using a single collection view with multiple sections, each section having its own composed layout.
